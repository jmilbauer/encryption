###RSA Encryption

rsav5.py is the final version (rsa-rsav4 are all previous versions)

This is a multicore implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. It includes implementations of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm & calculation of bezout pairs, as well as calculation of modular multiplicative inverses.

test.py is the file where I ran tests on individual functions.
